        <p>Hi {{ proposal.customer }},</p>

        <p>It was a great pleasure getting to meet with you and review your
          project requirements, I believe it is a
          great fit for the types of applications that I build out. Please feel
          free to check out some of my
          past projects <a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}" target="_blank"
                           rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

        <p>To successfully build out the application I will be
          utilizing {{ proposal.tools }},
          and a number of other tools to ensure that the project follows
          industry wide best
          practices.</p>

        <p>Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so
          in addition to incorporating
          everything that we discussed, I will also be creating a project
          management dashboard and
          sending you a project update message daily so that you can have a
          transparent view of the
          development as it takes place.</p>

        <p>To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that we
          discussed, I am estimating that it
          will take {{ proposal.estimated_hours }} hours in development time to
          complete. The project should take
          {{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }} weeks to complete and with my hourly
          rate of
          {{ proposal.hourly_rate }}/hour, the estimated total will be
          {{ proposal.hourly_rate * proposal.estimated_hours | currency:'USD':'symbol':'.0' }}
          .
        </p>

        <p>The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize the
          project and sign contracts.</p>

        <p>I am excited to working with you and build out this project.</p>
